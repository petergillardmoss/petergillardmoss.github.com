Four years into my career I gained my first position as a Tech Lead.  As a young ambitious developer with a sense of his own talent it was a position I had been eager to obtain.  Two years later and the experience and reality of leading a team had put me off leadership completely and I retreated back into the security of technology shunning any opportunity to take more responsibility.

Over time I came to understand the root causes of my mistakes and eventually regained the confidence to accept new leadership opportunities and grow as a leader.   Through coaching and mentoring other leads I have learned that the mistakes I made weren't unique to me but are common amongst technologists who move into leadership.

I'd like to share my mistakes and what I have learned in the hope that others may benefit.

# 1: Ability does not give you an entitlement to lead

Someone's technical ability is often one of the biggest factors when choosing them as leaders.  It is also certainly the most visible factor.  And here begins my first mistake: conflating that ability with the entitlement to lead.

In extreme examples this can lead to very negative behaviours if a lead abuses this sense of entitlement.  But more often a lead that believes that their position is dependant on being the most technically able team member creates feelings of insecurity which can lead to unhelpful competitive behaviours.  This is especially worse when other team members show greater ability on technical tasks.  It can also aggravate imposter syndrome as a lead may perceive other members of the team as more worthy and underestimate their own contributions and struggle to understand their own worth.  When this happens leads can become indecisive and avoid making decisions by constantly defer to those whom they believe to be more deserving.

This mistake can also prevent good people putting themselves forward as they believe the most technically competent individual has the right to lead.

# 2: Prioritising deep growth over broad growth

Techies aren't chosen for leadership roles based on their technical ability alone.  It is also due to the many other strengths, from influencing and persuading, to coaching, to understanding processes, to being a trusted advisor, to dealing with complexity, to strategic thinking (and many more), which would have stood out alongside technical prowess.  These competencies are much less visible and are probably needed in more nuanced ways throughout the working day and week.

It's important for new leads to understand the significance of these other competencies and rather than building themselves out in breadth across many areas they turn towards their most visible strength - technology - and focus on building in greater depth.

It is relatively easy thing for a technologist to build up new technical competencies.  We're used to acquiring technical skills, we know the formulas, the blog pages, the stack overflow posts, the ThoughtLeaders to follow, the conferences to attend, the books to read.  Given a half decent 'hello world' example and a few spikes later we're well on our way to picking up a new technology.

But other competencies don't work this way.  There isn't a 'hello world' for coaching or time management.  We don't know who to follow on Twitter to get the _right way_ to communicate decisions or organise teams or manage stakeholders.

This makes movement into the new domains required for leadership expensive.  As many of these domains are relatively new the lead is left feeling lost.  They may also mistakenly prioritise developing new technical competencies which are quick and easy to pick up and have obvious value over alien competencies which are hard to get into without clear value.


# 3: Too much startup

In my first lead role I preached Agile and came up with new ways of working for my new team.  I introduced new technologies and practices on a daily basis, from unit testing, ORM, continuous integration, pairing, optimistic source control, nant build files, story walls. If I read a blog post about an exciting new idea I incorporated it into our processes and tools.

And there lay just one of the many mistakes which made the next two years one of the biggest frustrations and failures of my professional life.  I had fallen for a romantic portrayal of leadership as being purely visionary and believed that ability to lead was down to the strength of vision.

The best way I can describe my experience is like opening a cafe.  When you start your full of ideas about menus, the type of coffee you'd serve, the decor and how you're cafe would be different and special.  But that stuff only counts up to the opening day.  After that the real work in running a cafe starts and you probably won't redecorate or buy new barista stations or change coffee suppliers for a few years.   Likewise, choosing tools, technologies and processes was all iteration 0 work, now came the day-to-day stuff.  The managing, dealing with stakeholders, representing your team in meetings, performance reviews, recruitment, budgets etc. etc..  And whilst I new enough to select svn, nunit, CruiseControl and C#, I had no idea about all that other stuff.


# 4: Continuing to see yourself as a producer

The goal of any development team is to maximise the amount of value produced.  Where developers are direct producers of value the team around them are working hard to ensure that their impact is as large as it can be.   One of the simplest  (but by no means the only) ways to do this is to ensure that the producers (in this case the developers) have the maximum time to focus on productive activities (i.e. producing code).  The rest of the team, from PM to BA to QA are working to ensure that the flow of work is as correct and smooth as possible and doesn't get blocked.  Simple version: in order to keep developers productive the team around them work to remove any obstacles or distractions so developers can focus on writing the right code to deliver value. 

When someone moves from techie to Tech Lead they are shifting from being one of the producers to being part of the team whose goal is to maximise overall impact (which includes removing obstacles and blockers).

This misunderstanding places a lot of stress on the new Tech Lead especially around time management. Specifically a feeling of not having enough time to code or pair with others.  Sometimes this is expressed in frustrations of too many meetings or a desire to have meetings only at certain times (core coding/pairing hours etc.).  In some extreme cases I've seen this manifest as a complete rejection of any activities which were not considered technical (talking to stakeholders for example).  All of these originate from the Tech Leads perception of being a direct producer rather than as someone who is maximising the impact of others.

In extreme cases the Tech Lead may perceive themselves as the main contributor in a team, especially in smaller teams where there is a large skills gap between the lead and the other members.  Under the combined pressure of normal delivery with additional delivery responsibility  the Tech Lead can feel that if they shift away from writing code the productivity of the team will significantly suffer.

# 5: Thinking in different cadences

A well run delivery team operates on a fast cadence.  Stories are moved across the wall to production as fast as possible, sometimes in hours although often in days.  Teams may work to the cadence of iterations or sprints that are a week or two long.

Tech leads are required to take on thinking at different cadences.  Sometimes these could be several weeks or even months long, such as governance or performance reviews, with some activities, such as planning or budgets, being annual.  Most of these activities happen outside of the cadence of delivery.

It can be hard to adapt to all these different cadences and longer timescales especially when the delivery cadence still hums the loudest.  Getting it wrong can lead to making poor decisions around priority calls by deferring work which isn't urgent.  It is also a challenge to guide delivery towards decisions that need to happen over longer cadences without distracting them or creating unnecessary noice about a change that is a long way off.  I've often witnessed teams make the wrong decision because they didn't understand the timescales involved in the information they'd been given.


# Picking up on different signals

When technology is your every minute of every day you become attuned to the feedback loops and signals put in place.  But when you move into a leadership role the signals come from other places.  

It's hard for techies to detect this shift especially as the concerns of each day are mainly the same: stories still need to be picked up and delivered, code needs to be written.  So the signals a new lead receive still look technical.

# 6: Focus on the things you care about - you can't know everything


# Collective responsibility
# Be positive
# Asking for support
