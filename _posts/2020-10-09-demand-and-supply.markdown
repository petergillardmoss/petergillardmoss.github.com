Any system (for example an organisation) has demands placed upon it by the human beings which interact with the system. This is true whether you are a team, a business, an NGO, a public service or a government. People make demands, these demands come from their needs and the system has to decide whether it wants to satisfy these demands by supplying something.

It's a simple equation. For businesses it translates to something more specific: humans, who we label customers, make demands, businesses supply products which meet those demands. This creates an exchange between product value and money. Doing this well makes profit. Making profit is the demand of owners/shareholders, the business model supplies this demand.

Demand and supply are a question and answer, a request and a response, a need, a desire and a fulfilment. When the two are in equilibrium, the right questions are answered by the right entities, the right desires are fulfilled by the right products, then magic happens. For a business, achieving this equilibrium between a multitude of stakeholders and the organisation, is the formula for success. When you look at the stellar rise of tech companies, whether Apple, Google, Netflix and their immensely disruptive impact on the markets, then you get the idea of the phenomenal impact an organisation can have *if* it gets this right. 

For us, as human beings, when society gets this equilibrium wrong, well, we have issues like gross wealth inequality, poverty, the existential threat of climate change, pandemics. I think you get the picture.

Put simply, every system is in a perpetual struggle to maintain this equilibrium between the demands placed on it - by customers, society, shareholders, employees - and its ability to supply.

Now, to my point. Demand is actually a pretty stable thing (although COVID is testing that). Supply, on the other hand, is hugely volatile and prey to continuous disruption. Technology, along with social change, is increasingly destabilising supply (not demand). Think about it, did CD sales collapse because Spotify disrupted people's demand to listen to music? No, people desires and needs to listen to music haven't changed. Spotify disrupted the supply of that demand by fulfilling the demand more completely. Likewise Kodak didn't collapse because people no longer wanted to capture memories or make art. The high street isn't struggling because people no longer want to purchase goods. And to really demonstrate it: during COVID the demand for education wasn't disrupted, the ability to supply it through the physical classroom was. The demand to collaborate with colleagues wasn't disrupted, the ability to supply it through colocated offices was. Who stepped in to meet this demand? Zoom. Over and over again demand is stable, and predictable. It is the supply side of the equation that is being torn up.

If your lens is only supply side, then you are going to be caught off guard by these disruptions.


In the past achieving equilibrium was simple, a system of relative political and economic stability meant that people's needs were fairly stable and so their demands were stable and supply predictable. This meant that businesses had a well established baseline for demand, and could focus on supply. The result was a winning formula of business which meant managing the bottom line by increasing supply through sales and cutting costs.


Technology has changed that. Regardless of social factors, people's needs are no longer stable, their expectations are constantly shifting and therefore, so are their demands. Despite this shift the supply mindset has resulted in strategies and ways of thinking built exclusively through the internal metrics of supply. 

Deming highlighted this as a problem in his book when he said "You can learn a lot about ice and know nothing about water.". A supply side focus "will not dig us out of the pit, only dig it deeper, make it more difficult to get out of". "Knowledge will not come from a committee inside. How could a committee produce new knowledge? The view must come from the outside. A committee in a company can hardly stumble onto it.: "Knowledge from outside gives us a view of what we're doing, what we might do, a road to improvement, continual improvement."

John Seddon, of Vanguard, is more specific: "Demand is the greatest lever for improvement... but typically managers know nothing about demand, at least nothing that’s of value to them in improving the system.". Vanguard classifies demand into two sorts,  "demands from customers that we ‘want’, the reason we are in business" (value demands) and "demand caused by a failure to do something or to do something right for the customer" (failure demand). This ignorance leads to organisations spending up to eighty percent of their capacity servicing failure demand, things they should have done right the first time.

This supply side thinking permits throughout the organisation into value stream maps, processes and even into design and user experience activities such as journey maps. The headline stages are articulated from the perspective of supply: "Register customer", "Share article", "Order coffee", "Pay for order" etc. Measures are then attached which are all supply side measures (number of registered customers, number of articles shared, coffees ordered etc.). The organisation, or teams, then start driving towards these internal supply side metrics and they are trapped in viewing their customers purely through this internal lens.

This observation is shared by Anthony W. Ulwick and Clayton Christensen "knowing more and more about customers... is taking firms in the wrong direction. What they really need to home in on is the progress that the customer is trying to make in a given circumstance—what the customer hopes to accomplish.". The jobs to be done framework focuses on gaining an understanding of demand and switching organisations processes away from supply side concerns to "focusing processes on the job to be done provides clear guidance to everyone on the team."



The demand isn't to 'search', the demand is to locate the product. There is no demand to add something to the shopping cart, or 

Deming, Vanguard, Anthony W. Ulwick and Clayton Christensen use different language - an outside view of the system, understanding demand, customer desired outcomes and jobs-to-be-done - to make the same point from economics 101: supply must meet demand and "without that lens, you’re doomed".




The laws of supply and demand are one of those economics concepts that are established as 'common sense'. Most people understand that prices rise and fall based on the relationship between consumer demand and a providers willingness, or ability, to supply to that demand.

The ideas of supply and demand go way beyond just buying and selling. Any entity (or system) has a variety of demands placed upon it by the human beings which interact with the system. This is true whether you are a team, a business, an NGO, a public service or a government. People make demands, these demands come from needs, the system has to decide whether it wants to satisfy these demands by supplying something.
