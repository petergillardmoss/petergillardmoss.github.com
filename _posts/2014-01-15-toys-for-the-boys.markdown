Toy manufacturers are a horribly irresponsible lot.  I bet it's hard to find many in the child development field that hand-on-heart believe that there is little damage done to child development due to the marketing practices of toy companies.

Toy companies have quite a considerable social responsibility.  Play is an activity central to a child's development.  It's too obvious a statement really but through play children learn about the world.  Toy manufacturers know that you can't sell a toy to a parent without telling them what vital skills the child will learn through its interaction.  Yet the way in which they market toys is in flagrant ignorance of these facts.  And this is because they are set on creating a world, for children, which is entirely based around sex-typing and sex-segregation.  Even today you'd be hard pressed not to find a toy store which is divided straight down the middle with "girls toys" on one side and "boys toys" on another.

# Role of play

Early in children's development play is an isolated experience, paediatrician's and child psychologists talk about a developmental milestone known as [parallel play][parallelPlay].  Then, slowly, children start to interact with each other and begin to play together.  It's at this stage children are using play to develop their social skills.  

So far so obvious?

One step back, important point: through play children develop their social skills.  These skills are the very same ones that you use now, and used in your first job, and in your university or college or school or party etc. etc.  These are the very beginnings of the skills that you use to form friendship groups, alliances both in the past and in the future.  These are the skills that you use to get on with people, persuade and influence people make the world a smooth place.  These are very important skills.  And through play children learn how to develop them.

And toys play a crucial role in this.

# Toys and social development

Talking to your adult self now: you're at a party, the place is divided: in one part it looks like a PS4 is hooked up, in another there's a load of sports stuff, in another music collection, in another someone's got all the cook books out and the place is like this all over with loads of different things.  What do you do?  Well, you choose the thing you feel most comfortable about and you go over to it hoping to find like minds.  On a slightly deeper level you might also look for the loud people if your a loud person, or the quiet people if your quiet etc.  And that's because that's how you learnt to socialize as a child.

Children form social groups around children who 'play like them'.  They look for signs: types of toys, types of behaviour etc.  If there's a matt covered in dinosaurs with kids playing at it and you sure know how to play with dinosaurs you're going to hang out there.  If there's some kid climbing the bookshelf and jumping around and you're kinda physical as well then that person looks like a good play mate.  See how toys play a crucial role in this?

And then comes all that nasty important social stuff like re-enforcement which could be 'banter', stereotyping, bullying etc.  That horrible stuff lovely 'innocent' children like to partake in, which is, again all about developing social skills, and again, toys are playing a crucial role in this.

Given how important this is why, oh why do toy manufacturers screw our kids up so bad?  Why do they _insist_ in sex-typing?

# Biology vs environment

Step back, a statement: There is nothing in biology which labels behaviours as right or wrong, normal or abnormal so any understanding around gender roles is purely social.  There's no such thing, biologically that dictates that girls play one way and boys play another.  You do that.  You as parents, as teachers, as relatives, as friends, as damn toy manufacturers marketing agencies even. You, you, you!  Or society as the academics put it.

Well, what's wrong with that?  What's wrong with saying "boys will be boys" and handing little girls pink dollies to play with?

# Gender roles and gender typing
There are two orthogonal things going on with children.  The first is arguably a neurological process and part of development and that is [gender typing][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_typing].  This is a process a child goes through where they become aware of their gender and attempt to understand what this means as part of their identity.  From childhood to adolescence children develop their own unique understanding of what gender is and from this form their ideas, attitudes and social behaviours around gender that they take into adulthood.  Or, as the academics put it: they form cognitive schemas around gender.

The second thing going on is [gender roles][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_roles_in_young_children].  These are the social and behavioural expectations around gender.  By the age of five children will have formed very strong ideas around gender roles.  Blakemore (1998) demonstrated that children from homes with more egalitarian primary care-givers, or those of same sex primary care-givers, displayed the least difference in attitudes to those of differing gender.  Basically children pick up all these ideas around what men and women do from their parents.

Gender typing and gender roles work together to create gender identities and gender views which are used to inform social behaviours and make social judgements.  

Even a child can recongnize that girls and boys are different.  It would be stupid to deny this.  But it would also be stupid to deny that they a mostly the same.  Charles Darwin noted [how similar play between apes and human children was][playApeDarwin] an observation which influenced his theories on evolution.  Considering how close children's play styles are to apes it shouldn't be too ridiculous to believe those of the same species are also similar?

Except if you're a toy manufacturer.

# Gender roles and toys
Let's role this up: children learn to socialize, and form social groups and habits through play.  Children understand there are boys and girls and they begin to form identities around gender and toys are the currency, the ***lingo-franca***, of play and therefore socialisation.

So the most stupid, numbskull thing you can do, in terms of social development, is get one bunch of toys, call them "girls' toys" and another bunch of toys and call them "boys' toys" and dump them at opposite ends of the room.  'Cos now, because boys want to understand what a boy is, and girls want to understand what a girl is, they will take 'girls are people that play with dolls' and 'boys are people that play with cars' and form their identities around them.  

Oh no, you could do something worse.  You could do that with colours too!

If boys and girls are told they are significantly different they will treat each other differently as a means of re-enforcing their identity.  They'll also bully other children who don't meet their understanding of what a girl or boy is.



It's quite shocking how little understanding of how children play the majority of toy manufacturers display.

Like many parents I get the 'pleasure' of regularly visiting the local ELC store.  The store is divided into two: on the left are 'boys toys' and on the right are 'girls toys'.  As you enter the store a number of selected toys - for obvious marketing reasons - are out for children to play with.  On the left are dinosaurs, cars, workbenches, electric guitars etc. and on the right - all painted a garish pink - are kitchens, ironing boards, dolls houses, vanity tables etc.  This is a common layout; I witnessed the same segregation at The Disney Store and Mothercare.  

Toy manufacturers, in collusion with toy retailers, work on the premise that boys and girls are inherently attracted to different toys and play differently from the other. A simple experiment can test this premise: stand a group of toddlers, of both genders, outside the shop and position them randomly (they'll do that themselves); let the toddlers into the shop and record the number of each gender at each side.  If the premise is correct we would be able to unambiguously observe that, as the children enter the shop, regardless of which side they enter on, the girls would immediately veer to the right and the boys would make a beeline to the left of the shop.  We should be left with a table of figures that clearly shows that the left side had mainly boys and the right mainly girls.  However this is just not the case.

In reality what you see girls and boys all over the place picking up toys from either side and mixing them. After a short time you'll discover that dinosaurs are at gas mark 5 in the oven, trucks are used as irons and toasters are being used as cannons for screw drivers.  And they are all crowding around the dolls house.  Children just don't subscribe to these cultural taxonomies.

Of course, as the children get older this changes...

## Gender roles and gender typing
There are two orthogonal things going on with children.  The first is arguably a neurological process and part of development and that is [gender typing][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_typing].  This is a process a child goes through where they become aware of their gender and attempt to understand what this means as part of their identity and social behaviour forming cognitive schemas around gender.  From childhood to adolescence children develop their own unique understanding of what gender is and from this form their ideas, attitudes and social behaviours around gender that they take into adulthood.

The second thing going on is [gender roles][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_roles_in_young_children].  These are the social and behavioural expectations around gender.  There is nothing in biology which labels behaviours as right or wrong, normal or abnormal so any understanding around gender roles is purely social.  By the age of five children will have formed very strong ideas around gender roles.  Blakemore (1998) demonstrated that children from homes with more egalitarian parents displayed the least difference in attitudes to those of differing gender.  

The problem is this, gender typing and gender roles work together to create gender identities and gender views which are used to inform social behaviours and make social judgements.  Because boys want to understand what a boy is, and girls want to understand what a girl is, they will take 'girls are people that play with dolls' and 'boys are people that play with cars' and form their identities around them.  Also, if boys and girls are told they are significantly different they will treat each other differently as a means of re-enforcing their identity.  They'll also bully other children who don't meet their understanding of what a girl or boy is.

## Cultural re-enforcement
Let's be clear what the marketing and sex-typing of the toy market is doing when we consider gender identity and roles.  The marketing is aimed at adults, not children.  Children don't hold these concepts and cultural biases.   Adults, however, form a set of cultural assumptions which they project onto their children.  And children, because they inherently desire to understand these concepts of gender, soak these things up like a sponge.  Research has found 

How many times do I hear someone say "oh their such boys" when they see boys push cars down ramps or "oh their so girly" when girls put a dress on a teddy bear?  Let's take a step back a bit.  Please identify what biological or neurological element is responsible for makes a girl want to play with a doll or a boy with a car.

Thought experiment: you find a lost aboriginal tribe which, prior to this moment, has been cut off from the rest of civilisation.   You put down a blue car and a pink doll.  What do you think would happen?  The 'car' gene and the 'blue' gene which formed the 'blue car' neuropathways exclusively in the boys would draw all the boys to the car and the 'pink' gene and the 'doll' gene which formed exclusively the 'pink doll' neuropathways would light up and draw all the girls.  That something genetic in either gender and draw them to the appropriate toy?  Nobody would be fool enough to believe such ridiculous nonsense yet parents swallow and pass on this nonsense daily.

## The role of toys in gender roles
The toy manufacturers marketing influences what toys you buy for your child.  Girls get bought lots of pink girly things like dolls and kitchens and boys get bought lots of boy things like cars and dinosaurs.  So, from a very early age girls and boys don't even have _access_ to the other toys.  So all they learn to play with are those toys that the toy manufacturers have deemed are appropriate to their gender.  So what happens when a child is in an environment where toys of the other gender are accessible?  Your little boy picks up a doll, you laugh and probably take it away and give them a car.  Your little boy picks up a car and rolls it, you cheer and congratulate them and hand them another car and join them on the floor to play.  Likewise, your little girl picks up a car, you smile "what a little tomboy" and ignore them.  You hand them a doll and start playing make believe with them praising them when they comb the dolls hair.  You project and reenforce cultural concepts of toys and gender through praise and supply.  This mechanism of reward and punishment is known as operant conditioning.

These things form part of a child's gender identity: children learn that girls are people who pick up and play with dolls, and boys are people that pick up and play with cars.

### Toy segregation
What happens if you dictate that one set of toys are 'boys' and another 'girls' and put them at opposite sides of the room?  What happens when you encourage your children to accept these abstract and meaningless concepts?  Well, after a while the girls go to one side of the room and the boys go to the other.  Because that's what you've taught them to do.  You have 'toy segregation' and segregation of toys encourages and facilitates segregation of genders.  So the girls and boys play separately with separate toys.  At this early age how damaging is this artificial segregation?

When social learning and gender mix it affects how children treat those of both opposite gender and their own.  Peer groups are incredibly important to children.  From a young age they will employ ideas of different social categories and shape their behaviour to normative expectations.  The result is the forming of social groups where children of similar category and behaviour come together and normalize to form an identity.  

One of the strongest means children use to form groups is around play compatibility.  Children seek out those whose play style matches their own.  Therefore gender roles begets sex-typing begets toy segregation begets gender segregation begets gender roles all in a big re-enforcing circle.

### Gender and sexuality
This is a more insipid and distasteful element of culture that is pretty mainstream and re-enforced through the sex-typing of toys and that's to do with gender identity.

Girl's generally get away with it.  If a girl plays with a dinosaur or plays football then their a 'toy boy' at worst, and in modern culture 'toy boy' is a little bit of an accolade.  In fact there are plenty of programs in schools etc. that actively encourage girls to partake in these activities (ironic really that we then expend so much energy trying to break down the cultural stereotypes we've been enforcing throughout infancy).

For boys on the other hand it's a different story.  Boys that play with pink toys are 'gay'.  I have heard, from a number of parents, that they don't want their boys doing ballet because 'it will make them gay'.  WTF?  Somehow doing ballet creates neurological pathways that influence your sexuality?  Playing with pink objects encourages homosexual thoughts?  Really?  Homophobia is so deeply rooted in our culture that not only do people believe this nonsense they fear it (no clearer example of homo'phobia')!

How did this happen?  Not only have toy manufacturers segregated toys by gender, segregated play by gender but have even managed to create an association between objects and colour with influencing sexuality.  It is a far, far cry from sanity!

2. Girls and boys learn gender identity
3. Gender roles form
4. Play and groups
5. Groups are re-enforcing

This finding, the effectiveness of peers on children's behavior, wasn't consistent across all children. The more children play with same-sex peers, the more we saw those effects on them," Martin says. She calls this "the social dosage effect."

6. Mix play is important
These different gender cultures can cause conflicts when girls and boys begin to associate more together as they date and interact in adolescence and adulthood. Because they don't share the same gender culture, girls and boys may have difficulty understanding each others' perspectives.
