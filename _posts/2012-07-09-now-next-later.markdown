When starting a project, or a new phase of an existing project, it is common for teams to try and capture a decent breadth of stories and prioritize and estimate them to form a backlog.  From that backlog the team can then start to organize the stories to form some sort of plan and an idea of the overall size.

This is often an intense process.  Teams usually size projects using the entire story list forcing them to analyse stories in detail and make decisions at the point when they know the least.  This low level of knowledge has teams struggling to achieve the impossible task of forming a complete picture. It also requires that they undertake a number of time consuming activities - prioritization, estimation etc. - on stories that may not be played for many months, if at all.  Not only does this give them a false sense of confidence but it is wasteful.

The team I work with in Thoughtworks Studios devised a method of organizing our backlog that tackled these issues.

We start by gathering the stories we believe we need for the project.  We then divide our backlog into three columns: _Now_, _Next_ and _Later_.  Each column is based on when we plan to deliver them: so the goal we are currently working towards (_Now_), the goal we believe we'll work on once we've completed this one (_Next_) and anything _Later_ than that.  We then move our stories into these columns.

This organization gives us two things:

1. We have a prioritized workload (after all, if we're not working on it _Now_ it can't be the highest priority).
1. We understand clearly what we have to focus on (i.e. _Now_).

Once we have roughly sorted our stories we start by deeply analysing _Now_; we do a little bit of analysis about _Next_ (but to a far lesser degree than _Now_); and we do no analysis of stories in _Later_ as we know very, very little.  Therefore, we can estimate with higher confidence the size of the work in _Now_; less, but some small confidence for _Next_; but any estimation of _Later_ is considered futile and valueless.

We also apply the same thinking to completeness: so _Now_ should be a fairly accurate picture of what we will deliver, _Next_ is a starting point but likely to be quite volatile, and _Later_ has no guarantees at all.
 
A side effect of this organisation is we consider anything in _Later_ a pipe dream.  The result is that _Later_ becomes a dumping ground for anything we suspect may be required in the future.  That doesn't mean some stories may move into _Next_ - and eventually move into _Now_ - but chances are the majority will live out their days in the _Later_ column.
