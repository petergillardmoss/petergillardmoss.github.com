# Capability
A core business ability: allow people to order books, manage employees, invest money.
# Process
A series of actions required to achieve a specific aim: buy an item, promote an employee, transfer money.
# Action
A specific act performed as part of a process.  Send out a parcel, increase employee's salary.

# Conversation
A conversation is a collection of interactions between two or more services that define the beginning and the end of an action.  One action is likely to create a series of different conversations in order to achieve the outcome. e.g. check inventory, assign item to customer, ship item to an address.
# Contract
What is required in order to carry out an action. To book a hotel I need the name of the hotel, when you wish to arrive and when you wish to depart.
# Negotiation
A type of conversation, and subsequent actions, between two or more services when an action fails in order to provide settlement: "I'm out to lunch, please come back in 5 minutes.", "these dates are not available but these ones are" or there may be no negotiation: "sorry, you are not authorised to do that".

# Identity
Something that provides a means to uniquely identify something. A customer ID etc.
# Lifecycle

# Context
# Request/Command
To request or demand that an action, or set of actions, are carried out.
# Event
Something that has happened with domain meaning. Distinct from an action.  An action may be "change a customers address" then event may be "a customer has moved house".

# Asset
A concept of something that has value and is central to the domain.  For Amazon books, CDs etc. are assets as are customers.  Addresses, dates of birth, credit card numbers are not.  Question: do processes organize around assets?

# Value
A representation of something in terms of attributes.  Customer details. 

# Fact
A record of something at a point in time.  Both values and events are 

Identity, value and fact are separate.  Facts are a combination of values and identities at a point in time.  A fact could also be an aggregate of multiple values.
