<p>I am the Head of Technology for Thoughtworks Technical Operations
  (TechOps) responsible for a number of systems both bespoke and
  off-the-shelf.  I have a wide ranging of experience in software
  development and consulting in various domains - from media to
  banking to SaaS products (in Thoughtworks Studios).</p>

<p>As someone who started my career in IT Support and moved to
  application development, I am passionate that teams are responsible
  for everything from cash-to-concept to keeping it running.</p>
